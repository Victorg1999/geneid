\indent \prog\ was used to visualize the genomic data-sets submitted to ISMB'99 Tutorial ``The challenge of annotating a complete eukaryotic genome: A case study in \textit{Drosophila melanogaster}''.
We thank the opportunity given by Martin Reese and Michael Ashburner from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project. We appreciate the ISMB'99 organizing committee help very much for allowing us to show the three panels poster for the whole meeting.\\
\indent We thank to Richard Bruskiewich, from Sanger Center and GFF-Specs Web Page curator, his helpful tips and comments on GFF-format. Also we thank to those people that have bet on GFF as data interchange format and those who have participated on the GFF mailing-list. We hope that GFF mailing-list will provide us a reference for GFF standard for a long time.\\
\indent Finally thank to Mois\'es Burset, Gen\'is Parra, Sergi Castellano and Enrique Blanco for their suggestions and their effort testing this program.\\[1ex]
