<h4>Feature key reference manual</h4>

The following manual has been organized according to the following format:

<pre>
Feature Key             the feature key name
Definition              the definition of the key
Mandatory qualifiers    qualifiers required with the key; if there are no
                        mandatory qualifiers, this field is omitted.
Optional qualifiers     optional qualifiers associated with the key
Organism scope          valid organisms for the key; if the scope is any
                        organism, this field is omitted.
Molecule scope          valid molecule types; if the scope is any molecule
                        type, this field is omitted.
Old GB key              the old related GenBank key(s); if there was no
                        corresponding feature key in the old GenBank feature
                        table, the field is omitted.
Old EMBL key            the old related EMBL key(s); if there was no
                        corresponding feature key in the old EMBL feature table,
                        the field is omitted.
References              citations of published reports, usually supporting the
                        feature consensus sequence
Comment                 comments and clarifications

Abbreviations:		
<pre>
accnum                  an entry primary accession number
&lt;amino_acid&gt;            abbreviation for amino acid
&lt;base_range&gt;            location descriptor for a simple range of bases
&lt;bool&gt;                  Boolean truth value.  Valid values are yes and no
&lt;evidence_value&gt;        value indicating the nature of supporting evidence.
feature_label           the feature label (follows naming conventions for all
                        feature table components)
&lt;integer&gt;               unsigned integer value
&lt;location&gt;              general feature location descriptor
&lt;modified_base&gt;         abbreviation for modified nucleoside base
[number]                integer representing number of citation in entry's
                        reference list
&lt;repeat_type&gt;           value indicating the organization of a repeated
                        sequence.  Currently valid values are <b>tandem,
                        inverted, flanking, terminal, direct, dispersed</b>,
                        and <b>other</b>
"text"                  any text or character string. Since the string is
                        delimited by double quotes, double quotes may only
                        appear as part of the string if they appear in pairs.
                        For example, the sentence:

                        The feature label "ops-tata" is used with the
                        "promotor" feature key

                        would be formatted thus:

                        "The feature label""ops-tata" " is used with the
                        " "promoter" "  feature key"
</pre>
