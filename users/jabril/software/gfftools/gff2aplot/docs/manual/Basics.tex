\chap{Basic Concepts}

In this chapter we would introduce you to GFF format definition as
well as how {\prog} handles your GFF files. The main goal is that you
will learn which is the proper record structure for GFF files. So
that, you will understand the program warnings when a record does not
fit such structure and being not drawn. {\prog} rejects all those
records not conforming with the record structures described in the
following sections.
