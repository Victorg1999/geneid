    ###PROGRAM### ###VERSION###

    a program to visualize the alignment of two genomic sequences
    together with their annotations. From GFF-format input files
    it produces PostScript figures for that alignment.

    src/###program###.pl
                         The main program, which converts GFF input
                         into alignment PostScript plots.
    src/parseblast.pl
                         A parser for the standard output
                         from most of the BLAST programs available
                         (NCBI-Blast/WashU-Blast/WebBlast/MegaBlast).
    src/blat2gff.pl
                         Filtering BLAT output into GFF.
    src/sim2gff.pl
                         Converting SIM output into GFF.
    src/ali2gff
                         C program that parses SIM/Mummer output
                         and produces GFF records for the alignment.

  bin/
                         It is empty until you make
                         the executables for the distribution.

  doc/
                         Contains documentation for ###program###,
                         initially the "User's Manual".

  examples/              A set of three examples,
                         in separate directories, each containing
                         GFF data, customization files and
                         PostScript output obtained with ###program###.
                         See the corresponding README file to see
                         how the figures were generated.
