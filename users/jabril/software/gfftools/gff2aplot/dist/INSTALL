  Installing ###PROGRAM### ###VERSION###
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  You will find a Makefile in the distribution directory that you should
  edit in order to install ###PROGRAM###. Depending on the system, you may
  also have to modify/update the ali2gff Makefile that can be found at the 
  src/ali2gff directory.

  ###PROGRAM### Makefiles were developed and tested on a Red Hat Linux box
  running GNU Make version 3.79.1.

  Once you have set up the makefile, just type:

     make

  and then:

     make install

  By default, the latter command will move all the scripts to /usr/local/bin
  but if you want to place all the exec files into another directory, just
  define the new installation path as follows:

     make INSTALLDIR=/your/path/bin install

  Our apologies but there is not a 'make test' yet...

  Thanks for using ###PROGRAM###, we hope you will enjoy it and it will
  be useful for your research.
