+ How to get a cvs user's password:

/home/adminmonstrebin/cryptout.pl "guest"
xHyT4TunSJpFg

so that we have the passwd "guest" for user anonymous, that is encrypted to "xHyT4TunSJpFg", which is the string we must provide to the passwd file:

anonymous:xHyT4TunSJpFg

+ We set a passwd for anonymous user (see previous item) because the CVS program was not working in case we did not provide a passwd for such user, throwing the following error:

cvs login
(Logging in to anonymous@monstre1.imim.es)
CVS password:
cvs [login aborted]: recv() from server monstre1.imim.es: EOF
